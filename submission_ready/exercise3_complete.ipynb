        "#### Conclusions for Correlation between Nuclear Energy Use and CO2 Emissions\n",
        "\n",
        "As has been shown, different countries show very different profiles in regards to this question. Overall, a slight trend can be observed that widespread use of nuclear energy (which is to say, the country has a high nuclear energy share) is accompanied by a reduction in CO2 emissions per kWh energy used in total. This trend hold especially strongly for cases where there is a rapid decline in nuclear energy use - such as in the cases of Lithuania and Japan - when carbon-based fossil fuels are used as immediately available replacements. For countries such as France, for which nuclear energy constitutes a large portion of their overall energy use, this correlation can also be observed in the stages of expansion of nuclear energy. For most countries however neither extreme holds, and thus no statistically significant correlation can be identified. "
